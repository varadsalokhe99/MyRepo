Mini Project (Design Level)
====================
 
Following points are expected to be covered in the project.

  1. Table Discription 
      -This includes attributes, datatypes and constraints used  on attributes.
      -Clauses like on delete/update set null/cascade  

  2.  Populating / clearing data from tables
       -Generating .sql file to populate / clear  data
       -Data populated in tables should me relevant and meaningful.

  3.  Implementation of constraints. 

  4.  Stored procedures/functions if applicable.

  5.  Triggers/cursors if applicable.
 
  6.  E-R diagram


Following points will be considered while evaluating the project

  - Data Normalization
    (Schema of your final tables will be checked thoroughly with applied  constraints )

  - Proper understanding of implemented constraints.
 
  - Explaination of  implemented stored procedure/function/ triggres  

  - E-R Diagram explanation.

  - Over all system understanding.
